# Qtum Core
https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum

Qtum Core is the heart of the Qtum project and implements the core blockchain protocol. It consists of many different components and is intended to be a heavy, but complete solution for most people in the ecosystem. Qtum Core is considered the reference implementation of Qtum, and thus is effectively the law for how the Qtum blockchain protocol should behave. The code for Qtum Core is based heavily on Bitcoin Core's code, and is written almost entirely in C++ with the exception of a Python based test suite. 

# QtumJS
https://github.com/qtumproject/qtumjs

This is our primary official API at the moment interacting with blockchain applications built on Qtum. 

# Qtum-Electrum
https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum-electrum

This is a lightweight wallet-only version of Qtum. This version can be used for storing and using tokens, but can not be used for staking and relies on external Qtum Core nodes to validate the network and transactions within it. 

# Qmix
https://github.com/kfichter/qmix-revamp

Qmix is Qtum's in-browser Solidity IDE (an homage to [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org)). Qmix is currently very much in beta, and we're looking for feedback! We've got a bunch of things that currently don't work and a lot of room for feedback.

# Dapp Developer Documentation
https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki

This is our documentation for decentralized application developers. This documentation is used by developers building their own applications on Qtum.
